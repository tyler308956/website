        <p>I discovered my passion for coding when I graduated from the University of North Texas. I had graduated
          with a Bachelor's degree in Spanish with a focus on Linguistics, but I decided that I wanted to use my
          language-learning method (see below) to learn code.</p>

        <h3 class="linguistics-heading">Linguistics, Languages and Cultures</h3>
        <p class="linguistics-paragraph">I discovered my passion for foreign languages when I started learning Spanish in high school; I
          knew I had found my 'niche' when Spanish speakers would tell me that they were impressed with how
          I would go out of my way to speak to them in their native language. The friends I made along the way
          really opened my mind to other cultures and ways of life outside of the USA, something that I am thankful for every day.
          for every day. After graduating high school, my love for Spanish took me on the path of going to college
          to pursue a degree in Spanish with a focus on Linguistics. I loved how there were so many international
          students studying at the University of North Texas because I was able to discover my second language -- Arabic.
          The majority of the friends I had made at the start of college were from Saudi Arabia and Oman and I immediately
          fell in love with how welcoming they were; it was the <b><span class="complete">complete</span></b> opposite of the where I grew
          up -- there was no what's-mine-is-mine-and-what's-yours-is-yours mentality that I had grown up with back home. I used to have
          a distored view of the Middle East until I started learning more and more about the culture. It got to the point
          where the majority of my friends were from Saudi Arabia and Oman, so I started to learn Arabic. I realized that
          there were many sources on the internet to learn languages -- especially for Arabic. Every day was spent immersing
          myself in the Arabic culture, which meant surrounding myself with all of my Arabic-speaking friends, which led
          to making <b>more</b> friends, and before I knew it, I was able to speak Arabic; the combination of online learning
          and surrounding myself with my Arabic-speaking friends led me to develop my method for learning languages.
